# SpaceBook
A repository for the SpaceBook app.

Please run 'npm install --global npm@latest' to make sure the packages are installed correctly asI have found older versions of node and npm do not work properly with install.

I have kept to the airbnb styling guide for js react as well as prettier using a linter in vscode.

To run the linter please run 'npm run lint'.
